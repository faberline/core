    resolve([from_env prefix]) --> absent([None: plaintext h2c])
    resolve --> invalid([Err: fail startup])

    config --> builders([rustls configs via service-tls])
```

The public contract is `raft_host::PeerTlsConfig`: `from_env(prefix)` returns
`None` only when all variables are absent, returns an error for partial or
unusable material, and exposes the validated paths and mTLS-required flag.
Its rustls builders delegate to `service-tls`; no private-key parsing or unsafe
operation is duplicated in service applications.

The contract explicitly does not change the Raft host's current h2c router or
peer dialing protocol. Consumers may validate and stage material now; TLS
termination requires a later acceptor/connector seam.
