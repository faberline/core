```mermaid

  tcp_config: { kind: process, label: "server-http derives TcpServerConfig and carries caller budget, DrainController, metrics, socket options, and drain timeout" }
  accept: { kind: decision, label: "server-tcp accepts a socket and attempts the shared ConnectionBudget" }
  rejected: { kind: process, label: "Budget denial closes the socket and calls connection_rejected exactly once" }
  admitted: { kind: process, label: "Admission calls connection_accepted exactly once and spawns one supervised handler task" }
  protocol: { kind: process, label: "transport-h2c serves one accepted stream with hyper-util auto HTTP/1.1+h2c and configured stream limits" }
  closed: { kind: process, label: "Handler completion or failure releases the permit and calls connection_closed exactly once" }
  signal: { kind: process, label: "server-lifecycle waits for SIGINT/SIGTERM, flips the shared drain owner, and holds the configured readiness grace" }
  stop: { kind: process, label: "server-tcp stops admission, waits for supervised tasks up to drain_timeout, then terminates remaining work" }
  policy: { kind: terminal, label: "service-http merges probes and application routes but owns no listener, signal, or drain-state implementation" }
