//! How far behind a learner is *right now*, as opposed to whether it was ever
//! admitted (#3583).
//!
//! `learner_read_eligible` answers the admission question and #3569's six rows
//! pin that meaning. It is not the question a bounded read needs. For lumen's
//! entire learner population it is also constant: `cluster.rs:280` puts every
//! learner in the membership the node is *constructed* with, `RaftNode::new`
//! seeds each of those targets with `0`, and `adopt_conf` records targets with
//! `.or_insert(...)`, so the seeded `0` is never replaced. Eligibility reduces to
//! `matched >= 0`, which is true of a learner that has replicated nothing.
//!
//! These rows are about the live figure instead: the number of committed entries
//! the learner has not got, measured against the leader's commit index, asked of
//! the leader, at the moment it is asked. Every row builds its group the way
//! `cluster.rs:280` does — learners present from construction — except the last,
//! which exists to show the admission answer is untouched.
