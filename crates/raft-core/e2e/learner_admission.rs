//! Adding a learner to a running group, and withholding its reads until it has
//! caught up (#3569).
//!
//! Eligibility is asked of the **leader**, about a named learner, and that is a
//! measured decision rather than a stylistic one. Two properties of this engine
//! close the window on the learner's own side:
//!
//! * `send_append_to` ships `log.iter().filter(|e| e.index >= next)` — the whole
//!   suffix in one message, with no batch cap;
//! * `take_committed` runs `while last_applied < commit_index`, and adopts the
//!   configuration entry *inside* that loop.
//!
//! So a learner reaches `last_applied == commit_index` in the same call in which
//! it learns it is a learner. Every target it could derive locally — the
//! configuration entry's index, its commit index at adoption, the `leader_commit`
//! it was last told — is already satisfied at the instant it exists. A row
//! asserting "ineligible, then eligible" against the learner's own view is
//! therefore green before any implementation, which is the false green this item
//! exists to remove.
//!
//! The lag is real on the leader, which holds `match_index[learner]` far below
//! its own commit index for as long as the learner has not replicated. That is
//! the fact these rows measure, and it is the fact `apps/lumen/src/api.rs:1041`
//! needs in order to stop admitting a seconds-old learner for a bounded read.
