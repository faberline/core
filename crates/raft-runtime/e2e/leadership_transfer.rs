//! Starting a leadership handoff from a running host, over the wire (#3586).
//!
//! # What was missing
//!
//! `raft_core::RaftNode::transfer_leadership` has been correct since #3571, and
//! `libs/raft-core/e2e/leadership_transfer.rs` measures it thoroughly — on an
//! in-process bus, against a node the row holds directly. Nothing that runs a
//! real host could reach it: `RaftHost` exposes no transfer entry point and
//! hands out no accessor for the locked node, so the operation existed and was
//! unreachable. #3571's own sweep records the consequence: deleting the
//! `RaftMsg::TimeoutNow` arm of the host's `send_request`, which drops the
//! message into the catch-all instead of posting it, left both crates green.
//!
//! These rows buy the wire. They run hosts that talk h2c to each other, so the
//! leader has to serialize the handoff, post it, and have the receiver act on
//! it before any of them passes.
//!
//! # Why three hosts rather than the two the wire needs
//!
//! Two hosts are enough to cross the wire, but in a two-node group "leadership
//! arrived at the node I named" and "leadership arrived at the only other node"
//! are the same sentence, and an implementation that ignores the target
//! argument satisfies both. The third host makes the name load-bearing: the row
//! names one of two eligible followers and asserts the other one did not end up
//! holding the group.
//!
//! Three hosts also make the catch-up wait real. Quorum in a three-voter group
//! is two, so a proposal commits without the named target having acknowledged
//! anything; the row has to wait on that target's own log rather than infer it
//! from the leader having committed.
//!
//! # Why the running host arrival wait is a liveness bound, and why the registry row is not
//!
//! In `a_running_host_hands_leadership_to_the_peer_it_names`, the host that hands off
//! stays leader and keeps heartbeating, so followers' election timers are continually
//! reset and a spontaneous election is unreachable. Leadership at the named target can
//! only have arrived via `TimeoutNow`, so the arrival wait is a generous liveness bound
//! to prevent hanging rather than a discriminator against an election floor.
//!
//! That reasoning does not transfer to the registry row, and measuring it by
//! the clock there would be wrong twice over. A `#[tokio::test]` runs on a
//! current-thread runtime, so a synchronous call on the test's own thread — a
//! TLS provider being installed the first time an h2c client is built, for one —
//! stops the host's tick task for as long as it runs, and elapsed wall-clock
//! stops meaning elapsed ticks. That row therefore asks for a term no
//! accumulation of spontaneous elections could have reached in its lifetime,
//! and asserts the exact value that arrives. The clock is not consulted.
