//! Each hosted group reports its own membership: which voters count today,
//! which voters count once a transition in flight completes, which members are
//! learners, and which phase of a transition the group is in (#3573).
//!
//! Every row reads the multi-group `/raftz` endpoint rather than a per-host
//! accessor, because the isolation these rows buy is a property of one process
//! hosting several groups, and a per-host reader cannot observe one group's
//! answer arriving under another group's key.
//!
//! A group is placed in its configuration through its durable record rather
//! than by driving a promotion: `RaftHost` exposes no membership-mutation API,
//! so a joint configuration reaches a hosted group the same way it reaches one
//! after a restart — `RaftStore::save` writes it and `RaftNode::from_persisted`
//! adopts it. The joint group's local node is a minority of both its sets, so
//! it never becomes leader, never reaches `check_leave_joint`, and the joint
//! configuration it reports is stable for the length of the row rather than a
//! window a sleep has to hit.
