# Contributing to raft-runtime

## Brief

How to change `libs/raft-runtime`. What it promises and the work roots it owns
live in [README.md](README.md); repository-wide authoring and verification
rules live in the root [CONTRIBUTING.md](../../CONTRIBUTING.md).

There is no phase ladder here. `leg.leg_root` resolves `apps/<project>` and
nothing else, so a change to this crate is authored and committed directly
rather than driven through `e2e -> unit -> logic`.

## Verification

| Gate | Command |
|---|---|
| unit + colocated tests | `cargo test -p raft-runtime` |
| implementor compile migration | `scripts/raft-implementor-build.sh` |
